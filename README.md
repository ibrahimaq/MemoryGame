# About
This is a basic 2x3 memory board game that can be re-played again and again. Sole aim of this project was to test my JavaScript skills and less-so on styling.

## Technologies used
- HTML & CSS
- Plain JavaScript

## Learning curve
This is one of the first projects built using JavaScript. The learning curve was immense, particularly the game logic. I worked with arrays mostly only to find out later that I could have used Booleans to make things simpler e.g. isMatched, but heck - I carried on with my logic as I wanted to see through my 'logic' being printed out onto the screen.
However I now know that using e.g. isClicked or isMatched is definitely more efficient than comparing two attributes.

## Things to improve on
- USE BOOLEANS! Makes code much more clean and efficient.
- Even though the main focus of this project was JavaScript, it does need improved styling.
